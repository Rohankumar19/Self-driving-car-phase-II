# Self Driving Car Project

Welcome to the Self Driving Car project! This project demonstrates the implementation of a self-driving car using various files and folders.

## Overview

This project consists of several files and folders organized as follows:

- **virtual world**: Contains files related to the virtual environment in which the self-driving car operates.
  - **world**: Main folder for the world-related functionalities.
    - **js**: JavaScript files related to world editing functionalities.
      - **editors**: Editors for different elements in the virtual world.
        - `crossingEditor.js`
        - `graphEditor.js`
        - `lightEditor.js`
        - `markingEditor.js`
        - `parkingEditor.js`
        - `startEditor.js`
        - `stopEditor.js`
        - `targetEditor.js`
        - `yieldEditor.js`
      - **items**: JavaScript files representing different items in the virtual world.
        - `building.js`
        - `tree.js`
      - **markings**: JavaScript files for different road markings.
        - `crossing.js`
        - `light.js`
        - `marking.js`

        - `start.js`
        - `stop.js`
        - `target.js`
        - `yield.js`
      - **math**: Mathematical utilities.
        - `graph.js`

        - `point.js`
        - `polygon.js`
        - `segment.js`
        - `viewport.js`
      - `world.js`: Main JavaScript file for the virtual world.
  - **saves**: Saved virtual world configurations.
    - `big.world`: Example large virtual world configuration file.

- **car.png**: Image file representing the self-driving car.

- **index.html**: Main HTML file for the project.

- **styles.css**: CSS file for styling the HTML elements.

- **car.js**: JavaScript file containing functionalities related to the self-driving car.

- **controls.js**: JavaScript file containing control functionalities.

- **main.js**: Main JavaScript file for the project.
